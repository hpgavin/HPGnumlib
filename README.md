# HPGnumlib
**HPGnumlib** is a set of codes for common tasks in numerical linear algebra, signal processing, random sampling, memory allocation, and file handling.

This library of functions includes C source and header files for:

* Cholesky decomposition of real matrices, (HPGcholesky)
* linear time invariant simulation, (HPGlti)
* SVD, LU and LDL decomposition, matrix products, Legndre polynomials, (HPGmatrix)
* random samples, (HPGrandom)
* finite differences, band-pass filtering, FFT, detrending, (HPGsignal)
* ordinary differential equations (initial value problems), (HPGode)
* ANSI color and file management, (HPGutil)
* memorly allocation from Numerical Recipes (NRutil)
